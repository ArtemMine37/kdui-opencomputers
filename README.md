# kdUI-OC (previously opencomputers-denisui)
The TherOS fork that's aimed to just be a bit more interesting and hilarious.
The features include:
- The installer that has only one feature: Install
- - Branch choices? Unstable? Custom? Nah, it won't work. Only stable will be chosen.
  - Does it install the system? Probably.
  - How's the system? It's fine, I guess...

# Installation
Just enter `wget https://github.com/ArtemMine37/opencomputers-denisui/releases/download/v1.0/installer.lua /home/installer.lua && installer.lua` if you want the legacy version
