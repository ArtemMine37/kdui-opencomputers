# kdUI-OC (previously opencomputers-denisui)
The TherOS fork that's aimed to just be a bit more interesting and hilarious.
The features include:
- The installer that has only one feature: Install
- - Branch choices? Unstable? Custom? Nah, it won't work. Only stable will be chosen.
  - Does it install the system? Probably.
  - How's the system? It's fine, I guess...
- The home screen that's just booooooring...
- Non-working file manager
- Ability to reboot or shut down (very useful tbh)
# Installation
Just enter `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArtemMine37/kdui-opencomputers/refs/heads/old-rel-1/sys/app/installer_new.lua /home/kdui-inst.lua && kdui-inst`
> Make sure you have a Tier 2 screen and an Internet card to run it.
